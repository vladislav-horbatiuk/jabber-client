This is fork of converse.js (https://github.com/jcbrand/converse.js) project.
Converse.js_ is a web based `XMPP/Jabber`_ instant messaging client.

It enables you to add chat functionality to your website, independent of any
specific backend. You will however need an XMPP server to connect to, either
your own, or a public one.
